# Ryan's (me) Personal Website
A website dedicated for showcasing who I am, this includes past and current projects, work experience, extracurriculars, and a bit about me.

## Description
Developed a website only using HTML, CSS and JavaSccipt without using external frameworks such as React. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and deployment and is publicly accessible. Here is the link for the website: https://tanzyryan.github.io/RyanPersonalWebsite.github.io/

## Future Improvements
Still quite a bit of improvements to be made especially accessibility as well as simplifying the JavaScript and CSS codebase. Additionally, new sections such as certifications and competitions are planned to be added.
