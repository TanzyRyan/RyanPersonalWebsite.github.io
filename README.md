# Personal Website
## June 2024
I always wanted my own personal website and so why not make one as a first project? The purpose of this website was to give me a place to talk about my projects as well as a way to show off and document my credentials.

Still quite a bit of improvements to be made especially accessibility as well as simplifying the JavaScript and CSS scripts

Hope you enjoy my website :)
